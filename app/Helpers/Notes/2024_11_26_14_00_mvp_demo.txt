Good people, ICOBA Meeting Note - as at 26/11/24

The meeting notes + Corrections

User end  — Onboarding Flow. 

1. Phone Number - Factor in the prefix of out-of-country people. 
2. The username should be a nickname. 
3. The graduation year should be the year of exit
4. The year of association should be set a year. 
5. We should have context text for these forms. 
6. For form input compulsory put the *** there.

Are you an existing member —— Why this? 

1. Yes — bring out a box. 
2. Membership ID combinations haven’t been defined very well, so many members don’t know how to use them at all
3. The Existing - Let’s leave it for now — ICOBA will get back to us on how to move on from here — pending feedback from the ICOBA people. 

At the Point of registration — Submit — The Popup has the wrong “CTA” Text — Change it. 

—— What if I didn’t complete those forms — Let the system save locally, so I can continue the registration process. 




Data Migration

Data Migration Issue - Raised by Segun ++ CEO. 
ICOBA are strongly for the Migration of Data. 
We are to design a flow that accommodates this, therefore people won’t have to verify at all, just reset passwords and move on into the system. 



Admin Area. 

- Change the Picture Banner area — Ask ICOBA people (if they have any). 
- Or UI Change to something different. 
- When a request comes in, let me get an email also —— Go into the set admin email and that of a General Email also. 


The Verification system 

— From ICBA People — Set Admin, Chairman, then Technical Committee. 
— What SBSC Captured — Set Admin, Set Chairman only. 

— The New Layer of verification is the chairman Technical Committee. 



Approve — Set Chairman 
- When I (approve ~~~ Verify), it comes to the Chairman, and then from the Chairman, the technical committee approves. 

The Process is Now: Set Chairman (Verify), Set Admin (Verify), Chairman Technical Committee (Approves Profile)… 


The Email Template — We have an Email Template already, Kindly implement it - FE Team. 


View Profile Stage. 

1. UI Team - The Banner Advertisements Should be updated.  
2. Once they come into the system, prompt them to Update their Data and Also make payment — UI Design. 
3. Those tags on profile should be yellow (Background) — UI Team. 
4. Profile Setup — Showing Percentage — UI team. — Show me what has been done and what hasn’t been done and prompt me to update my profile. 
5. For most of those forms, we should use straight and clear language and context text in some areas — Mobola should review where is needed. 
6. ICOBA would determine which data is compulsory that users need to fill out. 
7. At the spouse — Give me why I should supply the details of my spouse/child —— UI Team — FE to implement. 
8. Date of Birth — It should be the Month and Year of Birth. (Make it optional).
9. The Dues Payment — Show me a UI in the profile area — That shows the strain of dues (2). 
10. Show me the dues — It’s like repayment on a Loan. — Payment flow checkout. 
11. The Setup UI Profile Card - Should be redesigned — The BLUE CTA is not showing at all. 
12. We don’t have a wallet system - New Feature. ~~~ ICOBA would take the conversation further. 
13. ffff — When I have, don’t auto-charge. 
14. The UI (Popup) to Pay is not showing how much, I am to pay. 
15. When I make a payment, show me that string in my profile. 
16. We can make a partial payment —— Let FE and BE get back to us on this. — Partial doesn’t apply for backlog, it only applicable for the current year. 
17. Full Payment is when you can Vote and be voted for. 
18. For Private profile - Design a UI that shows that this profile is private — when someone views it. Also, you need to actually follow me and I accept for you to view my full profile — 
19. We need to have a conversation about the Family integration, they shouldn’t have access to the whole or the part system itself.   


Dues Configurations
1. We should be able to multiple select a set. 
2. Also, create multiple dues to apply for as many sets as we want. 
3.

Admin
- Issues of tracking the backdated dues — Let’s see who has paid and who hasn’t, so I can send them a BC. 



Event 
Elections 
AGM — Annual Event. !~~~ We should configure it as a major event. 
Admin should be able to POST that shows on the TL. 
The advert would be like a post - have the “Ad Tag” — Just like twitter. 
Request for advertisement flow from the customer end.
